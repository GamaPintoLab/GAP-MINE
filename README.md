## About
GAP-MINE is an algorithm for the prediction of gene associations with diseases and cell processes.
This algorithm is composed of the following steps:
1. Graph Construction (Biological Network);
2. Proximity Metric Computation;
3. Additional Module Selection (Embedding Construction);
4. New Association Prediction.

Additionally, this repository also contains several notebooks for the visualization of the obtained results and the validation of the new predictions.
